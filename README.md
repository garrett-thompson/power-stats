# power-stats
As an exercise for me to learn [Go](https://go.dev/), this is a CLI app for cyclists to calculate their [power zones](https://blog.onepeloton.com/power-zone-training-faqs-with-matt-wilpers-and-denis-morton/) &amp; their [power-to-weight ratio](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/training/the-importance-of-power-to-weight-and-how-to-improve-yours-164589), expressed in watts/kg.

These are both important training metrics for cyclists.
